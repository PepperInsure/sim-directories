# Directory Tree 

This script simulates CRUD like operations of a directory. Output shows up from the logger.

## Run instructions
1. Ensure you have python 3 installed.
2. Save the script.
3. Create an input file (e.g., `input.txt`) with the commands you want to execute, one per line.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `directories.py` is saved.
5. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
    python directories.py <input_file>
    ```
   Replace `<input_file>` with the name of your input file.

An example file made from the original problem is included.

To run the tests, use your IDE of choice or:
   ```bash
    python -m unittest test_directories.py
   ```
